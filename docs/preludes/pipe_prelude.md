The SingleM `pipe` subcommand performs three steps:

1. Finding discrete operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from a shotgun metagenome
2. Assign taxonomy to marker-specific OTU tables
3. Convert OTU tables into a overall taxonomic profile

In the first step, reads that encode conserved single copy marker genes are found. SingleM specifically finds reads which cover short (20 amino acid / 60 base pair) highly conserved sections ("windows") within those genes. Sequences covering those small sections are OTU sequences, and these OTU sequences exist independent of taxonomy. By default, SingleM currently uses 35 bacterial and 37 archaeal single copy marker genes.

In the second step, taxonomy is assigned based on comparing the nucleotide sequence of the window to GTDB species representatives' window sequences. If none are similar enough (i.e. within 95% identity or 3bp of the 60), then diamond blastx is used.

A common analysis is to convert a set of window sequences (i.e. a metagenome's OTU table) into a taxonomic community profile. This is achieved in the second step by considering the OTUs from the 59 different marker genes holistically, using trimmed means and expectation maximisation.

An overview of your community can be obtained like so:
```
singlem pipe -1 <fastq_or_fasta1> -2 <fastq_or_fasta2> -p \
   <output.profile.tsv>
```
Please use **raw** metagenomic reads, not quality trimmed reads. Quality trimming with e.g. [Trimmomatic](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170) reads often makes them too short for SingleM to use. Adapter trimming is unlikely to be detrimental, but is not needed.

The [examples section](/tools/pipe#examples) may be of use.
